Attention mechanism
1) (RNN) Bandanau -> Addition 


2) (RNN) Luow -> Dot Product  
Dot-product Attention computes the attention weights as the dot product of the query and key vectors

3) (Transformer) Vaswani -> Scaled Dot Product = Dot Product / akar N
Scaled dot-product Attention, a variant of dot-product attention that scales the dot product by the square root of the key dimension

An autoencoder is an unsupervised learning technique for neural networks that learns efficient data representations (encoding) by training the network to ignore signal “noise.” 

Auto encode :
1. Vanilla autoencoders (Optional)
2. Variational autoencoders
